\emph{\textbf{Key Points}\\
The recommendations in this section are based on the following set of principles:
\begin{itemize}

    \item 
\end{itemize}
}}
\end{tcolorbox}

In this last chapter, the principles developed in the previous chapters are brought to the application level. In other words, the somewhat theoretical considerations from the previous chapters are now applied to real-world problems.
