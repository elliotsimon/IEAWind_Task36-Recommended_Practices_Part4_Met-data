The following is a list of available instrumentation that will be discussed in detail in this chapter and recommendations made in how to setup these instruments and which implications the use of the various instruments have on data quality and usability in the operational real-time context in the energy industry.

Typical instrumentation for meteorological measurements in wind power context are divided into two categories: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item meteorological masts
        \begin{itemize}
            \item cup anemometers
            \item sonic anemometers
             \item temperature sensors
             \item pressure sensors
             \item hygrometer sensors
             \item precipitation sensors rain gauges   
        \end{itemize}
    \item remote sensing instruments
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Wind Profiling Radar
            \item SODAR
            \item LiDAR 	
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Wind Profiling LiDAR
                    \item Scanning LiDAR (Long-Range and short-range wind tracer)
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


Not so common instrumentation or additional instrumentation are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Microwave Radiometers (measures energy emitted at sub-millimetre-to-centimetre wavelengths at frequencies of 1â€“1000GHz)  
    \item Ceilometer (light source to determine the height of a cloud base. Ceilometers can also be used to measure the aerosol)
    \item Microbarographs (measures atmospheric pressure)
\end{itemize}

These instrumentation are more commonly used in research measurement campaigns and in meteorological projects. Literature on these types such as microwave radiometers are described by e.g.  \cite{Ulaby1982,Matzler2006}, for ceilometers by \cite{Morris2016}, or microbarographs by \cite{Monserrat1992}.



Typical instrumentation for meteorological measurement campaigns in the solar power context are divided into two categories: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Solar Radiation Sensors
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pyranometers 
            \item Pyrheliometer
            \item Rotating Shadowband Irradiometer
            \item Sun Tracker
            \item Reference Cell (e.g. Silikon Irradiance sensor)
            \item Sunshine Duration Sensor
        \end{itemize}
    \item Met Stations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item cup anemometers
            \item sonic anemometers
             \item temperature sensors
             \item pressure sensors
             \item hygrometer sensors
             \item precipitation sensors rain gauges   
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}




\section{Meteorological masts} \label{subsec:meteorological_masts}

Meteorological mast are still the most commonly used measurement instrumentation for the planning phase and operation of wind farms. An example is shown in Figure 2.
